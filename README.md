### About Me

My name is Eva Jin and I am currently a undergrad student in the major of Statistics at the University of California,Davis. My area of interests is data analysis, especially in big data and data management. I use R to accomplish assignments and projects for all the statistics courses and school research projects. So I am very familiar to this system and I have a great amount of coding experience.141B course has definitely been challenging, and at the same time super beneficial to us students.I have learned Web scraping, accessing APIs, text processing, plotting geographical data, and accessing database through SQLite through Python. All these computing skills definitely can me pursue my career goal.
