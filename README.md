### About Me

My name is Eva Jin and I am currently a undergrad student in the major of Statistics at the University of California,Davis. My area of interests is data analysis, especially in big data and data management. I use R to accomplish assignments and projects for all the statistics courses and school research projects. So I am very familiar to this system and I have a great amount of coding experience. 141B course has definitely been challenging, and at the same time super beneficial to us students.I have learned Web scraping, accessing APIs, text processing, plotting geographical data, and accessing database through SQLite through Python. All these computing skills definitely can me pursue my career goal.

### Career Goal 

My short-term goal is to be a data analyst. I want to use skills, technologies, practices for continuous iterative exploration and investigation of past business performance to gain insight and drive business planning. I will mainly focuses on developing new insights and understanding of business performance based on data and statistical methods. After gaining such analysis experience for several years, I want to be a consultant, helping organizations to improve their performance, operating through the analysis of existing organizational problems and the development of plans for improvement.
