## Welcome to Eva Jin's Website

### About Me

My name is Eva Jin and I am currently a undergrad student in the major of Statistics at the University of California, Davis. I am familiar with R programming. I have used R to accomplish assignments and projects for all the statistics courses and school research projects. I have a great amount of coding experience. 141B course has definitely been challenging, and at the same time super beneficial to us students. It gave me the basic idea of Python, one of the most popular and widely-used data analysis tool. From this class, I have learned Web scraping, accessing APIs, text learning, HTML parser, and accessing database through SQLite. All these computing skills can definitely help me pursue my career goal.

### Area of Interest 

My area of interest is data analysis, especially in big data and data management. I want to use skills, technologies, practices for continuous iterative exploration and investigation of past business performance to gain insight and drive business planning. I will mainly focuses on developing new insights and understanding of business performance based on data and statistical methods.
